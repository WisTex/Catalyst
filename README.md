**OSADA**

Osada is a social networking app and gateway which allows communication between the Zot/6 protocol/network to the ActivityPub protocol/network using the LAMP web stack.

Zot/6 protocol documentation is located here:

ActivityPub and many other protocols do not work well with Zot or Zot/6 because they do not understand the concept of nomadic identity. Osada provides a gateway between these services to smooth out the differences. It is ultimately designed to bridge ActivityPub with Zap, which is a pure Zot/6 social network application. 

Osada is based on Zap which is based on Red, which in turn is based on Hubzilla. It is otherwise unrelated to those projects and the software has a completely different scope and purpose.

==============

Most of the basic functionality is now present and working. This is still "use at your own risk", but it shouldn't burn down the house. 


If you encounter issues, fix them and submit a pull request.

Pull requests which add unnecessary features will be ignored. These should be implemented using apps and/or addons.

The database configuration is not yet "stable". You probably do not want to install this as a production service at this time, and please do not use this software for storing any critical information which is not backed up elsewhere.
