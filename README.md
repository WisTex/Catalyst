An open source fediverse server with a long history of innovation and disruption. See [FEATURES](https://codeberg.org/streams/streams/src/branch/dev/FEATURES.md).

This software is public domain and is not associated with any consumer brand.

Please note, this software has migrated from a developer-driven model to a community-driven model. This means that streams does not have dedicated developers working on new features or bug fixes. Instead, it relies on contributions from its users and distributions that choose to use it.

If you would like to take a more active role in the development and maintenance of streams, you can start by triaging new issues, fixing confirmed issues, creating or updating documentation and language translations, and reviewing contributions. If you need additional permissions, you may request them from one of the current maintainers.
