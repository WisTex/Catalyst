So what is this space? It is sort of a personal software repository where I explore the bounds of contemporary decentralised social communications technology. It will install as a fediverse server using the LAMP stack. It is regularly maintained and updated and you are welcome to help if you want. The commit log chronicles a dozen years of fediverse evolution from an alternative viewpoint. If you're looking for an open source project with layers of bureaucracy, this may not be the best fit - but you are free to fork the code and do that. 

This work is dedicated and released to the public domain with no strings attached. Be advised that many others have contributed code to this repository under a number of different OSI-approved software licenses over its 20+ year existence. This has no effect on any of your fundamental software freedoms; although corporate legal consultants might find this lack of license clarity "troublesome". This is intentional.

The current name of this repository implies fluidity. This code does not represent any specific product or brand or organisation. It represents an idea. The name of the software may change at any time for any reason. As a brand it technically does not exist. This is also intentional.
