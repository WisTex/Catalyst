So what is this space? It is a software repository where I explore the bounds of contemporary decentralised social communications technology. It will install as a fediverse server using the LAMP stack. It is regularly maintained and updated.

This work is dedicated and released to the public domain with no strings attached. Be advised that many others have contributed code to this repository under a number of different OSI-approved software licenses over its 20+ year existence. This has no effect on any of your fundamental software freedoms *unless* you represent a corporation or business entity; whose lawyers might find this lack of license clarity "troublesome". This is intentional.

If you look past the lack of a recognisable brand name or consumer focus or project license, you might find the most interesting and inherently useful fediverse platform in existence - and one of the most mature platforms in this space.
