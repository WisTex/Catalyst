# WisTex Catalyst

This is a personal project that is still under development and is missing most of the planned features. Eventually it will be a fediverse-powered communications suite with a built-in project and financial planner. It is meant to be your personal home base, where you can organize your time, thoughts, and communications, all in one place. 

Catalyst, also known as WisTex Catalyst, is a soft fork of Streams, an open source fediverse server with a long history of innovation. The core fediverse functionality of Catalyst comes from Streams, and this project is kept in sync with the Streams repository (one way only).

I already created something similar using PHP for my personal use. I will be porting that functionality to Catalyst and eventually release it as an open source project.

## Current Features

This is a soft fork of Streams, with additional themes, widgets, and addons included. It was created mostly to make it easier to install and update on my servers for development purposes.

Some features include:

* Fediverse Social Media Server
  * Supports ActivityPub, Nomad, and Zot6 protocols.
* Federated Single Sign-On Identity Server
  * Supports OpenWebAuth
* Cloud Storage
  * Supports WebDAV
* Backup Your Identity by Cloning It
  * Supports any server using the Nomad protocol.

Right now this is just a playground for experimenting with the platform, and is not ready for production. But these features came with Streams, and are therefore already available now.

## Planned Features

* Personal & Business Project Management
* Personal & Business Financial Management
* Integration with other Project Management, Financial, & CRM Systems.
* Email (IMAP) Web Client
