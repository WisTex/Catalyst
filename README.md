# WisTex Catalyst

This is a soft fork of Streams, with additional themes, widgets, and addons included. It was created mostly to make it easier to install and update on my servers.

The eventual goal is to create a stand-alone product called Catalyst which includes additional features that a forum community, small business, coach, or online course provider might find handy. It will also have a new default theme designed with this in mind.

Right now this is just a playground for experimenting with the platform, and is not ready for production.

## About Streams 

An open source fediverse server with a long history of innovation. See [FEATURES](https://codeberg.org/streams/streams/src/branch/dev/FEATURES.md).

This software is dedicated to the public domain to the extent permissable by law and is not associated with any consumer brand or product.

This repository uses a community-driven model. This means that there are no dedicated developers working on new features or bug fixes or translations or documentation. Instead, it relies on the contributed efforts of those that choose to use it.

A fediverse support group exists at
