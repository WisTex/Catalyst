	Router re-written to support calling class object methods as controllers
	All existing modules (160+) re-written as object classes
	Plugin hook interface adapted to call static class methods
	Context help improved dramatically with content for the most accessed pages.
	Reverted a compatibility change to support GNU-social events. We copied their feed format and their feed format is wrong (XML namespace collisions).
	Provide a querystring attribute to CSS/JS resources to avoid caching issues when our code changes (which is often). 
	Fix javascript detection and allow either positive or negative detection.
	Refactor the plugin hook registration procedure, provide 'unregister all' ability.
	Fix RSD (Real Simple Discovery) which has been broken for some time.
	Update smarty library to 3.1.29
	Update jquery.textcomplete to 1.3.4
	Update font-awesome to 4.6.1
	Update SabreDAV to 3.0 (PHP version requirements prevent us from pushing it further at this time)
	Help text added to cmdline utilities config and pconfig
	Reworking of the database logging facility to avoid the rare but troublesome recursion when the log facility needed to query the DB internally to obtain config parameters. 
	Implement singleton delivery (emulate nomadic identity to singleton networks and services)
	Fix empty album name in photo activities when photo is stored in top level folder.
	Allow engineering units to be used in service class data size restrictions (400M, 1G, etc.)
	Lots of work on bbcode auto-completion
	Admin interface provided to manage external resource repositories
 	Oembed security reworked. Now all sources are filtered by default unless blocked.
	Remove the date-string version and use only STD_VERSION
	Add categories and categorisation filtering and the ability to edit all apps (including system apps) for a given channel 
	Ensure the ability to translate names of all system apps (except those provided in addons)
	Provide ability to add categories to content from channel sources
	Lots of work on the presentation of the ACL widget to enhance usability and intuitiveness
	Allow somebody to follow a channel from a pasted redress containing a Unicode lookalike of the @ sign.
	Add conditional syntax to Comanche (if/then/else)
	Convert Comanche to an object class
	Removed IE6 compatibility code
	Explicitly close DB on shutdown/exit instead of allowing it to close naturally
	Allowed delayed publish of webpages
	Show current repository versions of master and dev on admin page and warn if your installation has fallen behind master
	Provide some extra security checks to import data and files to prevent mischief
	Block CalDAV/CardDAV namespace reserved words from being used as a channel nickname/redress since Sabre is somewhat inflexible in this regard
	Plugins:
		Diaspora 
			markdown translator work needed to eradicate the Diaspora Comment Virus.    
			upgrade all inbound paths with the most recent protocol changes (several of these)
			convert 'diaspora_meta' (Diaspora Comment Virus) to iconfig and eradicate from sites with Diaspora disabled
			implement social relay and allow following tags
			upgrade statistics.json to NodeInfo. Currently hubzilla sites are tagged as 'redmatrix' because the NodeInfo schema lacks extensibility and project names are used to designate protocol compatibility rather than protocol names.
		Std-embeds
			New addon to allow a handful of corporate providers to run unfiltered embed code (youtube, vimeo, soundcloud) 
		Various:
			upgrade font-awesome icons and adapt a few addons to Objects and the new hook interface and new controller interface
			
Hubzilla 1.4
	[This list may appear brief, but encompasses a huge amount of re-writing and re-factoring
	of the internal code structure to gain long-term performance and stability and provide a standard
	interface to alternate protocol federation plugins which were made possible by the UNO configuration.
	UNO is a configuration of hubzilla introduced in 1.3 with reduced complexity and which provides 
	improved protocol federation potential to other networks by virtue of removing nomadic identity 
	(which is not possible to model or work around using other network protocols).]
