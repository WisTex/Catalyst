/**
 * @brief ACL selector json backend.
 *
 * This module provides JSON lists of connections and local/remote channels
 * (xchans) to populate various tools such as the ACL (AccessControlList) popup
 * and various auto-complete functions (such as email recipients, search, and
 * mention targets).
 *
 * There are two primary output structural formats. One for the ACL widget and
 * the other for auto-completion.
 *
 * Many of the behaviour variations are triggered on the use of single character
 * keys however this functionality has grown in an ad-hoc manner and has gotten
 * quite messy over time.
