Privacy Notice May 2018

How your information will be used
=================================

Information you provide to this website may be stored and used to provide services to you.

We require an email address to idenitfy the account holder. This will not be shared with
any other website or service. It is used to send you notifications about your account and
perform administrative tasks such as resetting your password. You have the option to 
opt-out of all email notifications through your settings. 

Communication channels created on this website require a name and a photo or avatar. A
default avatar will be chosen if you do not supply one. The name, avatar, and a link to 
the channel webpage will be shared with other servers and services in order to refer to
this identity. The name does not need to be your real name and the photo or avatar does
not need to resemble you.

All other information you supply to this website is optional. 

As a social communication and cloud storage service, you will usually be using this website
to share information with others. We provide a range of privacy options to allow you to
restrict this sharing to only those you choose. 


Processing of your information
==============================

Our processing of your information is limited to storing it for you to use. We MAY keep logs
of activity to help diagnose software issues and to maintain security of the system against
intrusion. These logs are routinely deleted after a few days. 

We MAY (if you have provided this permission) try to suggest frendships or connections based
on analysing publicly available information about your connections. This is currently the most
advanced data "processing" performed at this website. You may restrict access to this information
if this processing is undesired. 

If supplied, we MAY use your gender to formulate text messages in your native language, for
instance "Bob commented on HIS post."

In all other cases, your data is stored under your desired privacy policy and to the best
of our ability is only shared with those who you have elected to share it with.  

We do not share your private information with third parties or analyse your behaviour or personal
characteristics. We have no advertisements or business relationships with advertisers.  

We MAY be asked or forced to divulge information provided by you in response to legitimate
criminal and legal proceedings. Where possible we will notify you if this happens. 
  

Access to your information
==========================

Some communications are shared with other websites. Those using the same software will usually 
have similar privacy policies. 


You may be shown embedded videos and provided links to visit other websites as part of your
day-to-day activities using this website. This MAY expose you to monitoring by external services, such
as (but not limited to) Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Each website operator is allowed to configure
whether or not embedded content is permitted.

Further access to your personal data and stored files is under your control.  

Our storage of your data is provided under your implied consent through your continued use of
the service. You may withdraw this consent at any time and on account deletion we will remove
all data which belongs to you. The process of deletion may take several days as we also make a good faith
effort to delete it from any internetworked websites that have been provided a copy. 


All data and files stored for a communications channel are available for you to
download for either archival puposes or to transfer to another compatible website.
